# Docker / Podman (Testing)
Using this install method, you will be able to run git4everyone on a container using Docker or Podman.

Run the makefile (It's at *ide/* folder) with the `docker-build` argument to build the image as specified on the Dockerfile, and then with the `docker-run` argument to create and start the container using the previous image.

```sh
make docker-build
make docker-run
```
